            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p id="first-paragraph">Hi there, thanks for visiting my page! My name is Carly, I'm a student at Code Fellows in the Code 201 course currently. I live in the Seattle area, and feel very fortunate to call this place home. When I'm not learning to code, I enjoy spending as much time as I can outside. I enjoy skiing, mountain biking, road cycling, hiking, and surfing.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Education History</h2>
            <p id="second-paragraph">I graduated from Snohomish High School, and went on to attend Western Washington University. While at Western, I bounced around between a few potential majors: pre-physical therapy/kinestiology, biology, secondary education, and mathematics. I graduated in 2014 with a BS in Mathematics. It was tough, but I learned a lot about hard work and perseverance trying to get through the program. A lot of it felt way over my head, and I often question why I did it. I thought I wanted to become a secondary education math teacher, but graduated from school feeling so defeated and burned out with school that I had to find something else. I learned a lot about myself those few (yes, more than 4...) years at Western, and I know what I learned will serve me well in some way in the future.
