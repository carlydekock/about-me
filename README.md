## About Me 

I built a website with facts about me, in the form of a guessing game for the user to interact and learn more about me.
I added in prompts for user input of a guessing game, for the user to guess a number. They have a set number of tries, which exists in a loop with feedback of higher or lower for their guesses.

### Reflections and Comments
* This offered great practice with loops.
* I struggled with arrays, and how to loop within an array to search for a value.
